One security flaw though, and the whole pile tumbles down on you to throw your customer passwords to the world.</p><p>In this talk we take a stroll down through a modern web stack and examine some recent major security breakages in each layer to see how they work and why. With any luck we can work out how to avoid this sort of thing in future too, when either using or building such tools, but if all else fails we can at least relax from all the careful balancing with a little schadenfreude.</p>"
